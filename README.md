# üåø EnviroTrack: Unified Environmental Research Platform

**Topics:** #BackendEngineering | #DataEngineering | #EnvironmentalData | #NestJS | #OpenData | #ClimateTech

**EnviroTrack** is a robust, modular backend system that serves as a unified platform to collect, store, and expose critical environmental data, with a primary focus on **air quality**. It aggregates data from multiple global APIs and user-defined local monitoring stations, providing a single, comprehensive source for environmental research, policy analysis, and climate-focused applications.

Built on **NestJS (TypeScript)** and **PostgreSQL**, EnviroTrack simplifies the complexity of storing and combining environmental data from disparate sources by automating synchronization, transformation, and exposure via clean REST APIs.

## ‚ú® Features

### Unified Data Ingestion (ETL)

  * **Unified Data Model:** Combines local station data with data synced from multiple external sources (e.g., OpenAQ) into a single, queryable API.
  * **Automated Data Sync:** A cron job runs regularly to fetch the latest air quality measurements from thousands of global monitoring stations.
  * **Extensible Data Sources:** Designed to support multiple external APIs, including:
      * ‚úÖ **OpenAQ API** (Air Quality)
      * ‚úÖ **NASA POWER API** (Temperature, Meteorological Data) *(Future Integration)*
      * ‚úÖ **World Bank Data API** (Emissions, Economic Indicators) *(Future Integration)*
  * **Local Data Ingestion:** A dedicated REST API allows researchers to define their own "local" monitoring stations and submit air quality readings for them.

### Architecture & API

  * **RESTful API:** A clean, well-defined set of endpoints for managing stations and retrieving unified data, documented with **Swagger/OpenAPI**.
  * **Scalable Architecture:** Built with **NestJS**, using **Prisma** for type-safe database access and a modular structure for easy extension.
  * **Comprehensive Testing:** The project includes unit tests for core logic, including data upserts and retrieval.
  * **Dockerized Deployment:** Simplified deployment and portability using **Docker** and **Docker Compose**.

## üß© Architecture Overview

The platform uses an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) approach to manage data from external sources and provides a unified access layer.

[ETL Layer: Node.js/NestJS scripts for ingestion + transformation]
           ‚Üì
[Database: PostgreSQL via Prisma ORM]

[REST API: NestJS Backend]
           ‚Üì
[Client/Dashboard (Optional)]

## üå± Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing.

### Prerequisites

  * **Node.js** (v18 or later recommended)
  * **Yarn** or **npm**
  * **PostgreSQL** or **Docker**
  * An **OpenAQ API Key** (required for automated sync)

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Michealtimi/EnviroTrack-Research-Platform-.git
    cd EnviroTrack-Research-Platform-
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    # yarn install
    ```

3.  **Set up the database (Easiest with Docker):**

    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d
    ```

4.  **Configure Environment Variables:** Create a `.env` file and add your credentials:

    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```

    *Update `DATABASE_URL` and `OPENAQ_API_KEY` in the newly created `.env` file.*

5.  **Run Database Migrations:** Apply the database schema using Prisma Migrate.

    ```bash
    npx prisma migrate dev --name init
    ```

6.  **Start the Application:**

    ```bash
    npm run start:dev
    # or
    # yarn start:dev
    ```

    The application will be running on `http://localhost:3000`.

## üèóÔ∏è API Usage

The API is documented with **Swagger** at **`http://localhost:3000/api`** when the application is running.

### üß™ Core API Endpoints

| Endpoint | Description | Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`POST /stations`** | Create a new local monitoring station. | `.../stations` |
| **`POST /air-quality`** | Submit an air quality reading for a local station. | `.../air-quality` |
| **`GET /stations/unified`** | **Primary endpoint for analysis.** Retrieves stations from both OpenAQ and local database, with powerful filtering (city, source, etc.). | `.../stations/unified?city=London` |
| **`/api/temperature`** | *Future* - Get aggregated temperature data. | `.../temperature?city=Lagos` |
| **`/api/emissions`** | *Future* - Get CO‚ÇÇ emissions data. | `.../emissions?year=2024` |

## üîß How It Works & Project Structure

The platform's core logic is managed by the following services and modules:

  * **OpenAQSyncService:** Runs an **hourly cron job** to fetch, upsert stations, and save the latest air quality measurements from the OpenAQ API.
  * **StationModule/AirQualityModule:** Manages the CRUD logic for both local and OpenAQ-sourced station and measurement data.
  * **PrismaService:** Centralizes the database connection and client for the entire application.
